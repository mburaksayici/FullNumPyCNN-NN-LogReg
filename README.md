# FullNumPyCNN-NN-LogReg
CNN-NN-LogReg coded on full NumPy on MNIST
Final codes are inside of the mehmetburaksayicicode21602940 folder. A lot of test files in the main folder, but last versions are in mehmetburaksayicicode21602940.


EE485 final.pdf includes explanation of the algorithms and the theoretical concepts.
